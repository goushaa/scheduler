# OS Operating System Course Project

In the operating systems project, we developed a comprehensive system focusing on process management and memory management. The project aimed to simulate the behavior of an operating system by implementing various scheduling and memory management algorithms.

## Features

- Manage processes using multiple scheduling algorithms such as Highest Priority First (HPF), Shortest Remaining Time (SRT), and Round Robin.
- Manage memory allocations of newly arriving processes using algorithms like the Buddy Algorithm and First Fit Algorithm.

## Project Overview

The project aimed to showcase the functionality and effectiveness of these scheduling and memory management algorithms in a simulated operating system environment. By simulating process execution and memory allocation, it provided insights into the performance and efficiency of different algorithms in handling varying workloads and memory requirements.

## Scheduling Algorithms

- **Highest Priority First (HPF):** Prioritizes processes based on their importance.
- **Shortest Remaining Time (SRT):** Selects the process with the shortest remaining time to execute.
- **Round Robin:** Ensures fairness by allocating a fixed time slice to each process in a cyclic manner.

## Memory Management Algorithms

- **Buddy Algorithm:** Divides memory into blocks of varying sizes for efficient allocation and deallocation.
- **First Fit Algorithm:** Selects the first available memory block that can accommodate a process, optimizing memory utilization.
